# Dynamic Programming Euler's Number

The mathematical constant $e$ (Euler's number) is defined as follows:

$$ e = \sum^{\infty}_{i=0} \frac{1}{i!} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} +
\frac{1}{1\cdot 2} + \frac{1}{1\cdot 2\cdot 3} + \frac{1}{1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot
4} + \ldots$$

I've provided an implementation of a function to approximate $e$ up to a number
of $n$ terms in `code.js` for you. However, it does repeated work -- identify
where the repeated work occurs and avoid it through bottom-up dynamic
programming (not memoization). Change the implementation accordingly.

Test your new functions; I've provided some basic testing code in `code.test.js`
but you need to go beyond that.

Was initially unsure how to further improve testing, received help from Daniel Collins.

I certify that I have listed all sources used to complete this exercise, including the use of any Large Language Models. All of the work is my own, except where stated otherwise. I am aware that plagiarism carries severe penalties and that if plagiarism is suspected, charges may be filed against me without prior notice.

## Runtime Analysis

What is the worst-case big $\Theta$ time complexity of your algorithm?

Because we have "simplified" our factorial function down to a constant time operation for each call, the overall time complexity is only $\Theta$(n), because our loop iterates over all values of n, performing the constant time factorial within.

In latest iteration factorial function is no longer used at all, and our loop simply performs the constant time operation internally for each iteration, however time complexity does not change.
